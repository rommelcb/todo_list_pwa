# Todo List PWA

A basic Todo List application that lets you add todo items and make a list of todos. The application uses localStorage to persist the entered items in the list so that you can still retrieve them after closing and reopening the app.

This project is part of my learning series on "Progressive Web Applications". The project was based on a tutorial made by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY38RvRIxYODO4penyxUwTg) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

The technologies used in this project are:
- HTML5
- CSS3/SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- localStorage
- Git

## Installation

You need a basic web server like "Live Server" to run the application.

## Usage

To add an item, you enter desired todo in field and click add button. The added todo item will be displayed as a list of checkboxes below. Listed item can be automatically deleted by checking the checkbox.
